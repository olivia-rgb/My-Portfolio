    description: 'It‚Äôs a fun and educational game that helps in improving vocabulary and spelling skills.Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that can be played by two or more players1. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the others try to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses1. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, each representing a letter.The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins1. Otherwise, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed. ',
